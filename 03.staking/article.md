Stake your PIVs and earn rewards by helping secure the PIVX network.

===

The PIVX blockchain is powered by a **Proof-of-Stake** system that encourages it's users to secure and operate the network and in return, earn rewards.

Stakers are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain and receive rewards when they do so. For each new block added to the blockchain (about every 60 seconds), 4 PIV are created and paid to a single  staker who wrote the block.

The frequency on which you can expect to receive rewards depends on the amount you are staking. These calculators can be used to estimate your rewards potential:

* ~~https://pivx.org/proof-of-stake~~ (calculator requires updating)
* https://toolbox.pivx.org/rewards

!!! **NOTE** - The frequency with which a staker will receive rewards is random. The output of these calculators are indicative only. 

### Requirements to Stake PIVX

To start staking you will need:
* A PIVX balance with at least 600 confirmations,
* A PIVX Core Wallet that is:
  * Running the latest PIVX release.
  * Synchronized to the latest block.
  * Unlocked for staking.
  * Open and connected to the internet 24/7.

For [cold staking](/staking/cold-staking), your staking node needs to meet all the above conditions and have whitelisted its delegation for staking.

Any PIVX holder can stake their coins and there is no minimum balance.

!!! **NOTE** - Although you can stake as little as 1 PIV, the probability to receive a staking reward will be extremely low.

### How Do I Start
You first need to decide whether hot or cold staking works best for you.

As mentioned in the requirements section, you need a PIVX Core Wallet connected to the internet 24/7 to stake your PIVs.
You can either stake your PIVs using the Core Wallet that contains your PIVs (hot staking), or leave the wallet staking your PIVs offline and delegate the staking to another online wallet (cold staking).

Running your own staking node is generally the preferred option, as it provides additional nodes (thus further decentralization) to the PIVX network, but, it might not be a viable/profitable option for smaller PIVX balances.

So if you have a server/computer (even a Raspberry PI works!) available for staking, go ahead and start [Hot Staking](/staking/core-wallet).
If hot staking is not practical for you, then go ahead and delegate your PIVs for [Cold Staking](/staking/cold-staking).

!!! **NOTE** - Cold Staking makes it slightly more cumbersome to spend your PIVs. If you transact with your PIVs a lot then hot staking might be the best option for you.
