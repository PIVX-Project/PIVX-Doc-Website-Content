[faqs]
[faq question="Why is my masternode not becoming Enabled?"]
Please make sure that **both** the online wallet and wallet holding the 10,000 PIV are both running the latest software and updated to the latest block. Out of date software and forked blockchains are a common cause.  
[/faq]
[faq question="I started my masternode, and it advanced through the queue to be next (or soon) to pay, yet it doesn't pay. Why?"]
When a masternode first starts, it has to operate for a time to qualify for rewards. The qualifying time is approximately three days.  
[/faq]
[faq question="I've received some masternode rewards and I want to spend them. How do I do it?"]
You should move the rewards with care to avoid disrupting the masternode configuration. If you are committing 10,000 PIV using a Ledger hardware wallet, you can use the SPMT tool to spend your rewards.
