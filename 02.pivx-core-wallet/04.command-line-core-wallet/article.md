### Description of the pivxd Server Process

The process to launch the PIVX Core Wallet in command line is called pivxd and can be found in the bin folder of the pivx core wallet.

The base command to launch the pivx core wallet is:

	pivx-[version]/bin/pivxd -daemon

The pivxd process accepts multiple command line options, that can be listed (along with their description) using the following command:

	pivxd --help

When no options are specified, the pivxd process will use default values for all parameters (such as date folder, log file, etc.), or the ones specified in the pivx.conf file.

The pivxd server logs all its activities in the following file:

	$PIVX_HOME/debug.log

### Start the pivxd process automatically when the server starts

1. Create a service file

	sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/PIVX.service

2. Copy the following to the newly created PIVX.service file. The elements in purple are to be modified according to the version of PIVX, your path, and your username:
