Your journey with PIVX starts here!

===

Welcome to the PIVX Documentation website, check out our quickstart guides, tutorials, and FAQs!

The community is very active on Discord, so [join us on the PIVX Discord!](https://discord.pivx.org/)

## A Brief Overview of PIVX

PIVX (Protected Instant Verification Transaction) is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that introduced the world's first zk-SNARKs based financial data protection protocol on a Proof of Stake blockchain in 2020. This protocol was given the name SHIELD and was announced on November 5th, 2020.

If you want to learn more about PIVX, visit our official website https://pivx.org/ and read the [PIVX Economics Whitepaper](https://pivx.org/economics).

## Getting Started with PIVX

The first thing you will need is a wallet to hold your PIV. The PIVX Core Wallet is the solution that offers the most advantages:
* It has all the functionalities of the PIVX network available natively.
* It is the most secure option.
* Running the Core Wallet adds a full node to the blockchain, so you contribute to securing the PIVX network.

Visit the [PIVX Core Wallet](/pivx-core-wallet) page and decide if it's the right solution for you!

You can also choose a thirdparty wallet, some of which are mentioned in [Mobile & Hardware Wallets](/mobile-hardware-wallets).

## Buying PIVX

Once your wallet is up and running, you need to pick an exchange and buy your first PIVX using either Fiat money or another Cryptocurrency. Current exchanges are maintained on the [Exchanges](https://pivx.org/exchanges) page of the official website.

You can then transfer your PIV from the exchange to your core wallet.

## The PIVX Rewards System

All blockchain communities that are decentralized have some sort of reward system for people who help secure their network. In PIVX, anyone who has PIV can help secure the network and is also able to receive rewards for their efforts by contributing to the proof-of-stake mechanism.  

The first two methods below are two ways you can use your PIV to earn rewards. If you don’t have any PIVs to participate in the network, you may be able to earn PIVs by helping the community.

#### Method 1 – Running a Masternode
[Running a Masternode](/masternodes-and-governance) which requires 10,000 PIV.

#### Method 2 – Staking Your PIV
[Staking](/staking) your PIVs which has no required minimum PIV.

#### Method 3 – Helping Out
There are also opportunities available all the time to help out with community projects funded by PIVX. If you help these projects along, you become eligible to earn PIVs for your time and work. These opportunities include development, marketing, customer support and more. If you’d like to help out with these activities, please reach out to us on Discord or in the Forums.

#### Amounts Distributed
Every block (approx. 60 seconds) 20 PIVs are created (sometimes called minting), which are then automatically divided into three pieces:
* 10 PIV goes into a pool (The Treasury Budget) that is used to fund the growth of PIVX. Allocations are voted upon by the Masternodes owners as part of the monthly treasury allocations.
* 4 PIV are randomly distributed to the staker who validated the block.
* 6 PIV are distributed to a Masternode owner.

The reward system by design has a lot of randomness built into it. This is done for security purposes, and it makes it impossible to predict accurate returns.

Indicative calculators are available on the [PIVX](https://pivx.org) website and the [PIVX Toolbox](https://toolboc.pivx.org/rewards) website and provide fair estimates of the potential returns for both staking and masternode ownership.
