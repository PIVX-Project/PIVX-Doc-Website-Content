PIVX currently does not offer an official mobile wallet.  Any version previously available requires an upgrade to be compatible with the latest version of the PIVX protocol.  

As an alternative to running a full PIVX Core Wallet, you can also use a _Third Party_ mobile wallet or a hardware wallet to manage your PIVs.


The [PIVX downloads](https://pivx.org/downloads) page provides a list of hardware & mobile wallets that have been tested by the community.

!! **WARNING** - Please make sure to do your own research and due diligence prior to trusting a third-party service with your keys to limit the risk of losing your coins!
