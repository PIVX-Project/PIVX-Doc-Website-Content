Explore different wallets to store your PIVX.

===

When it comes to wallets, you have options!  For some, it may even make sense to have multiple wallets. Your task is to find out which one works best for you.

## PIVX Core Wallet
The **[PIVX Core wallet](/wallets/pivx-core-wallet)** is the standard PIVX wallet.  While it is the **_most feature rich wallet available_**, it runs on a PC or VPS (Virtual Private Server) running Windows, Linux, or macOS which makes mobile transactions very cumbersome.  

**Pros:**
* Decentralized and does not require a third party to facilitate transactions
* Can operate as a Masternode server or controller
* Can operate as a Cold Staking Node
* Can Perform Both Shield and Transparent Transactions
* Supports Sheilded Memo features
* Non-Custodial

**Cons:**  
* Not mobile friendly


## MyPIVXWallet
**[MyPIVXWallet](/wallets/my-pivx-wallet)**, also known as **MPW**, is a non-custodial light wallet which works completely from within a standard web browser.  It _is not_ necessary to download the entire blockchain. **MPW** is under heavy development  - features and improvements are constantly being added or improved.

**Pros:**
* Very fast and lightweight 
* Works on most desktop and mobile browsers
* Very low data consumption
* Can Perform Both Shield and Transparent Transactions

## Hardware Wallets
The [Ledger](/wallets/ledger-wallet) hardware wallet is currently the only known hardware wallet device that supports PIVX.  

A Ledger device keeps your private keys in a completely offline environment isolated from your internet connection which can protect your private keys from hackers and malware. 

**Pros:**
* Can hold PIVX in addition to other cryptocurrencies
* Works on desktop and mobile devices
* Non-Custodial  

**Cons:**  
* Shielded transactions currently not available

## Third Party Wallets
A third-party wallet is just a wallet that was not created by PIVX developers.  These wallets can come in many different forms such as a desktop app or an Android or iOS mobile app.

The [PIVX downloads](https://pivx.org/downloads) page provides a list of third-party wallets that are known to support PIVX.  Note that most third-party wallets do not support the full functionality of the PIVX Core wallet or MyPIVXWallet. Third party wallets may also be Custodial (see FAQ below).

### Wallet FAQs

[faqs]
[faq question="Non-Custodial VS Custodial Wallets"]
PIVX wallets can be broken out into two different types:
* Non-Custodial Wallet (preferred)
* Custodial Wallet

With a Non-Custodial wallet, like the PIVX Core wallet or MPW, you are the only one with access to your private keys, therefore, you also have complete control over your PIVX.

In contrast, a custodial wallet is a wallet where the third-party (someone else) has complete control over your private keys and therefore, your PIVX.  Centralized Exchanges are custodial.  It is best practice to withdraw your PIVs from the exchange once your trades are completed and that you **_NEVER_** use an exchange as a long term wallet.
