title: 'Ledger Hardware Wallet'
---

A Ledger hardware wallet keeps your private keys in a completely offline environment isolated from your internet connection which can protect your private keys from hackers and malware.  Visit the [Ledger website](https://ledger.com) to learn more about this device.

While your PIVX on a Ledger hardware wallet can be accessed with the [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) app for desktop and mobile devices, the Ledger Live app does not currently support Cold-Staking or Masternode management. The following apps or software can help you interact with the Ledger device so you can get more from your hardware device:
* [MyPIVXWallet](/wallets/my-pivx-wallet) for Sending and Receiving PIV
* The [PET4L](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PET4L/releases/latest) software for Cold Stakers
  * _PET4L = PIVX Emergency Tool for Ledger_ 
* The [SPMT](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX-SPMT/releases/latest) software for Masternode management.
  * _SPMT = Secure PIVX Masternode Tool_
