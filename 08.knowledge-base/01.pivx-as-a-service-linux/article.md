The PIVX Core Wallet can be setup as a service on Linux to start automatically when the server starts.

1. Create the service definition file as `/lib/systemd/system/pivxd.service`
2. Put the following content in the file. Make sure you customize the user (set to `pivx-user` in the example below, and the path to the `pivxd` binary)
```
# It is not recommended to modify this file in-place, because it will
# be overwritten during package upgrades. If you want to add further
# options or overwrite existing ones then use
# $ systemctl edit pivxd.service
# See "man systemd.service" for details.
#
# Note that almost all daemon options could be specified in
# /home/pivx-user/.pivx/pivx.conf
#

```

3. Update systemd configuration:
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

4. Start the service
```
sudo systemctl start pivxd
```

5. You can check the status with:
```
sudo systemctl status pivxd
```

6. If successful enable for system startup:
```
sudo systemctl enable pivxd
```
