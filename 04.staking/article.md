Stake your PIV - Help secure the network and earn rewards!

===

The PIVX blockchain is a Proof of Stake system that encourages it's users to secure and operate the network by staking their coins. If you're not familiar with the PIVX PoS concepts, or with the PIVX Core Wallet we recommend you visit our [Getting Started](/getting-started) page prior to reading this. 

Stakers are responsible for adding new blocks to the blockchain, and receive rewards when they do so. For each new block added to the blockchain (about every 60 seconds), 4 PIV are created and rewarded to the staker who wrote the block.  

The frequency of receiving rewards depends on the amount you are staking. These calculators are available to help you estimate your potential rewards:

* https://toolbox.pivx.org/rewards

! NOTE: The frequency on which a staker will receive rewards is random. The output of these calculators are indicative only. 

### Requirements to Stake PIVX

To start staking you will need:
* A PIVX balance with at least 600 confirmations
* A PIVX Core Wallet that is:
  * Running the latest PIVX wallet, currently version [version]
  * Synchronized to the latest block
  * Unlocked for staking only
  * Open and connected to the internet 24/7

For cold staking, your staking node or a third parties node needs to meet all the above conditions and additionally have the delegated cold staking address whitelisted for staking.

Any PIVX holder can stake their coins, there is no minimum balance.

! Although you can stake as little as 1 PIV, the probability to receive a staking reward will be extremely low.

### How Do I Start

You first need to decide whether hot or cold staking works best for you.

As mentioned in the requirements section, you need a PIVX Core Wallet connected to the internet 24/7 to stake your PIVs. You can either stake your PIVs using the Core Wallet that contains your PIVs (hot staking) or, leave the wallet staking your PIVs offline and delegate the staking to another online wallet (cold staking).  

Running your own staking node is generally the preferred option as it provides additional nodes (thus further decentralization) to the PIVX network.  It might not alaways be a viable/profitable option for smaller PIVX balances or stakers whose power or internet bandwidth is limited.  In these cases, cold staking is the best option.  

If you have a server or computer (even a Raspberry PI!) available for staking, go ahead and start [Hot Staking](/staking/staking-core-wallet).  

If hot staking is not practical for you, then go ahead and delegate your PIVs for [Cold Staking](/staking/cold-staking).

! NOTE: Cold Staking makes it slightly more cumbersome to spend your PIVs. So if you transact with your PIVs a lot hot staking might be the best option.
