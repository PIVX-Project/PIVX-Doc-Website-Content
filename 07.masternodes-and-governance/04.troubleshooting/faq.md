                question: 'Why is my masternode not becoming Enabled?'
                response: 'Please make sure that both the online wallet and wallet holding the 10,000 PIV for staking are both running the latest software and updated to the latest block. Out-of-date software and forked blockchains are a common cause.'

                question: 'I started my masternode, and it advanced through the queue to be next (or soon) to pay, yet it doesn''t pay. Why?'
                response: 'When a masternode first starts, it has to operate for a time to qualify for rewards. The qualifying time is approximately three days.'

                question: 'I''ve received some masternode rewards and I want to spend them. How do I do it?'
                response: 'You should move the rewards with care to avoid disrupting the masternode configuration. If you are committing 10,000 PIV using a Ledger hardware wallet, you can use the SPMT tool (made by PIVX developers) to claim the rewards.'
